The result numbers signify the forecasted number of employees leaving each organization type for each quarter of the year 2024. Here's what each column represents:

- `OrganizationType`: This column indicates the type of organization for which the forecast is made. Each row corresponds to a specific organization type.
- `Q1_2024`: This column represents the forecasted number of employees leaving the organization type in the first quarter of 2024 (January to March).
- `Q2_2024`: This column represents the forecasted number of employees leaving the organization type in the second quarter of 2024 (April to June).
- `Q3_2024`: This column represents the forecasted number of employees leaving the organization type in the third quarter of 2024 (July to September).
- `Q4_2024`: This column represents the forecasted number of employees leaving the organization type in the fourth quarter of 2024 (October to December).

Each row in the DataFrame corresponds to a different organization type, and the numbers in the columns represent the forecasted employee leaving counts for each quarter of 2024 for that particular organization type. These forecasts can be used for resource planning, budgeting, or other strategic decisions by the 
respective organizations.

The code provided performs forecasting for the number of employees leaving each organization type for the four quarters of 2024
