To perform the forecasting using Spark, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the dataframes into Spark DataFrames.
2. Prepare the data:
   - Join the two DataFrames based on the organization name or code.
   - Calculate the number of employees who left the organization for each period (quarter or month) until December 2023.
3. Choose a forecasting model:
   - You can use Spark MLlib or external libraries compatible with Spark, such as Facebook Prophet, to perform forecasting.
4. Train the forecasting model:
   - Use historical data (2018 to 2023) to train the forecasting model.
5. Forecast the number of employees:
   - Use the trained model to forecast the number of employees for the period from January 2024 to December 2024.
6. Visualize the forecasted trend:
   - Plot the forecasted trend of employees leaving in quarters for 2023 to 2024 using suitable visualization libraries compatible with Spark.

Here's a high-level example code using PySpark and Prophet for forecasting:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import quarter
from fbprophet import Prophet

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Employee Forecasting") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Assuming df_org_spark contains organization data and df_emp_spark contains employee leaving data

# Merge the two dataframes based on organization name or code
merged_df_spark = df_org_spark.join(df_emp_spark, df_org_spark.organization_name == df_emp_spark.organization_name, "left_outer")

# Calculate the number of employees who left the organization for each quarter until Dec 2023
employee_left_count_spark = merged_df_spark.groupBy(quarter("date_of_leaving").alias("quarter")).count()

# Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame for compatibility with Prophet
employee_left_count_pd = employee_left_count_spark.toPandas()

# Rename columns for Prophet compatibility
employee_left_count_pd.rename(columns={'quarter': 'ds', 'count': 'y'}, inplace=True)

# Train Prophet model
model = Prophet()
model.fit(employee_left_count_pd)

# Make future dataframe for forecasting (Jan 2024 to Dec 2024)
future_pd = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=4, freq='Q')  # Assuming quarterly forecasting for 2024

# Convert Pandas DataFrame back to Spark DataFrame
future_spark = spark.createDataFrame(future_pd)

# Forecast the number of employees
forecast_spark = model.predict(future_pd)

# Show forecasted trend (convert to Spark DataFrame if necessary)
forecast_spark.show()

# Visualize the forecasted trend (using suitable visualization libraries compatible with Spark)
# Example: Convert forecast_spark to Pandas DataFrame and then plot using matplotlib
forecast_pd = forecast_spark.toPandas()
forecast_pd.plot(x='ds', y='yhat', title='Forecasted Trend of Employees Leaving (2023-2024)')
```

Ensure that you have installed the required libraries (such as Prophet) on all Spark nodes if you are running in a distributed environment. Adjust the code according to your specific data structure and requirements.
