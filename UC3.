To perform the forecasting using Spark, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the dataframes into Spark DataFrames.
2. Prepare the data:
   - Join the two DataFrames based on the organization name or code.
   - Calculate the number of employees who left the organization for each period (quarter or month) until December 2023.
3. Choose a forecasting model:
   - You can use Spark MLlib or external libraries compatible with Spark, such as Facebook Prophet, to perform forecasting.
4. Train the forecasting model:
   - Use historical data (2018 to 2023) to train the forecasting model.
5. Forecast the number of employees:
   - Use the trained model to forecast the number of employees for the period from January 2024 to December 2024.
6. Visualize the forecasted trend:
   - Plot the forecasted trend of employees leaving in quarters for 2023 to 2024 using suitable visualization libraries compatible with Spark.
